# Izhikevich-Neuron-Simulator
General Izhikevich spiking neuron model MATLAB simulator with highly-customizable forcing via an internal arbitrary waveform generator. Useful for the study of constant, ramped, periodic, or combined forcing; stochastic/noisy driving, and/or as foundational code for more advanced studies into Izhikevich neuron models and spiking neuron models in general.
